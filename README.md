# A Unified, Structured URI Specification

Our work is still starting.

The [wiki](https://github.com/urispec/urispec/wiki) contains
collaborative documents and link collections.

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/urispec/urispec/issues) contains
questions, discussions, action items, and problems with the work to
date.

The [W3C Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/urispec/) is used
primarily for the
[public-urispec@w3.org](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-urispec/)
mailing list and to track group membership.

You are welcome to join us and we'd love to work with you!
